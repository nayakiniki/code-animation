# Problem Definition
Understanding algorithms can be challenging without visual representation. Traditional text-based explanations make it difficult to grasp processes like sorting and searching.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered Code-to-Animation Converter that transforms programming code into interactive visualizations. By leveraging AI, graph-based parsing, and animation tools like Manim and Pygame, the system will automatically analyze code, generate structured steps, and create animations.

# Algorithm Visualization Research  

This project explores how algorithms can be visualized using animations and simulations.  

## Goals  
- Study sorting, searching, and graph traversal algorithms.  
- Test tools like Manim, Matplotlib, and Pygame.  
- Create visual examples for education and learning.  

## Research Topics  
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort).  
- Searching Algorithms (Linear and Binary Search).  
- Graph Traversal (BFS and DFS).  

## Tools Investigated  
- Manim – Mathematical and algorithm visualizations.  
- Matplotlib – Graph plotting.  
- Pygame – Interactive animations.  

This repository will be updated with research findings and example implementations.
