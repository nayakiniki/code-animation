Problem Definition
Understanding algorithms can be challenging without visual representation. Traditional text-based explanations make it difficult to grasp processes like sorting and searching.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered Code-to-Animation Converter that transforms programming code into interactive visualizations. By leveraging AI, graph-based parsing, and animation tools like Manim and Pygame, the system will automatically analyze code, generate structured steps, and create animations.
